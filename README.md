TNRPG is a text-based role-playing game currently under development as a learning exercise for the Rust programming language. The game aims to create a souls-like experience with mechanics inspired by medieval fantasy settings. 🏰

## 🎮 Game Mechanics

- **Character Stats**: Each character has ❤️ Health, 💠 Mana, and ⚡ Stamina. Different actions consume these resources, such as attacking, using abilities, or healing.
- **Attributes**: In addition to the core stats, characters have attributes like 💪 Vigor, 💥 Strength, 🏃‍♀️ Agility, 🧠 Intelligence, 👐 Dexterity, and 📖 Wisdom. These attributes influence the effectiveness of actions, damage modifiers, and item bonuses.
- **Items, Armor, and Weapons**: Characters can equip 👜 items, 🛡️ armor, and ⚔️ weapons that modify their basic attributes or grant special abilities.
- **Classes**: Different character 🗺️ classes will be available, each with unique starting attributes and abilities.

## 🚀 Development Plan

The project is divided into two phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Implement the core game mechanics and story in a text-based terminal interface.
2. **Phase 2**: Develop a simple 2D game engine and add graphics to the game.

## 📋 Requirements and Dependencies

Currently, the only requirement is to have the Rust programming language installed. As the project progresses, additional dependencies and requirements will be added to this section.

## 🚀 Installation and Usage

Instructions for installing and running the game will be provided once the project reaches a more complete state.
